# Game_of_life
a small implementation of Conway's game of life because I was bored 

## To-do 
- [x] actually implement the game of life logic
- [ ] optimize the logic more
    - [ ] parallel processing 
    - [x] bit manipulation (it is really good for game of life but not other Cellular automata)
- [x] autoplay and show gen
- [x] add more cool Cellular automata
- [x] add a way to change between the rules and maybe even a way to set your own 
- [ ] hot reload for development? (litrely no reason other than it's a cool idea)
- [ ] Record GIF ? And add one to the repo
