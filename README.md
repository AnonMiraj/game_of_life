# Game_of_life
a small implementation of Conway's game of life because I was bored 

## todo 
- [x] limit the borders
- [x] actually implement the game of life logic
- [ ] fix the scale for borders
- [ ] fix the huge memory leak :(
      
~~- [ ] try and represent each cell in a 1-bit register~~ (very hard kinda)
- [ ] optimize the logic more  
- [x] add more cool Cellular automata
- [x] add a way to change between the rules and maybe even a way to set your own
